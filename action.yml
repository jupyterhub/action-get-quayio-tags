# Define your inputs here.
inputs:
  repository:
    description: The quay.io repository in the form OWNER/IMAGE
    required: true
    default: ''
  version:
    description:
      The new application version, must be MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH unless strict=false.
      Ignored if allTags=true.
    required: true
    default: ''
  allTags:
    description: If 'false' (default) assume this is being run on the latest
      version of the image you are tagging.

      If 'true' return all tags in output, not just matching ones. Use this when
      you need to pass other tags to
      jupyterhub/action-major-minor-tag-calculator. For example, when
      backporting a fix to an older version
      jupyterhub/action-major-minor-tag-calculator needs to know all newer tags
      so that it knows whether to update MAJOR.MINOR, MAJOR, latest, etc. If you
      have a large number of tags you may hit a quay.io API limit.
    required: true
    default: 'false'
  strict:
    description:
      Whether to allow any version format, default is to only allow
      MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
    required: true
    default: 'true'

# Define your outputs here.
outputs:
  tags:
    description:
      The list of tags. If allTags=true this is the unfiltered list of tags.
  buildNumber:
    description:
      The build number to use for the next image tag (VERSION-buildNumber)
